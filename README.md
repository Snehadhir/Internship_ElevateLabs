## Projects Included

---

### [Calculator (Java Console-Based)](./Calculator/)

#### Objective:
To build a basic Java program that functions as a calculator using the command-line interface.

#### What I Did:
- Developed a console-based calculator in Java.
- Used `Scanner` to accept input from the user.
- Implemented arithmetic operations using `switch` statements.
- Created a loop-based menu that continues until the user exits.

#### Features:
- Supports **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.
- Menu-driven interface for ease of use.
- Displays results and prompts clearly.
- Handles invalid inputs and divide-by-zero errors (enhanced version).

#### Technologies Used:
- Java (Core)
- Scanner for input
- Control structures (loops, switch-case)

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Practiced writing clean, modular Java code.
- Strengthened understanding of loops, conditions, and input/output in Java.
- Improved skills in building interactive console applications.

###  [Student Record Management System (CLI)](./StudentRecordSystem/)

####  Objective:
To simulate a basic record management system that allows CRUD operations on student data using Java OOP and CLI.

#### What I Did:
- Created a `Student` class with attributes: roll number, name, age, and course.
- Wrote a main class `StudentRecordManagement` to manage the logic.
- Implemented a **menu-based CLI** using loops and `Scanner`.
- Used `ArrayList` to store student objects dynamically.
- Ensured roll number uniqueness and provided feedback for all operations.

#### Features:
- Add new student records.
- View all students and display total count.
- Update existing records by roll number.
- Delete student records.
- Validates duplicate roll numbers.
- Clean and user-friendly output format.

####  Technologies Used:
- Java (OOP concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation)
- ArrayList for dynamic storage
- Scanner for input
- Loops and conditional logic

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Learned to build CRUD-based applications using Java.
- Practiced object-oriented programming.
- Understood how in-memory data storage can simulate databases.
- Improved input handling, validation, and error feedback.

### [Library Management System (CLI ‚Äì Java)](./LibraryManagementSystem/)

A Java-based system to manage books and users from the command line.

 Source File: `LibraryManagementSystem/LibraryManagementSystem.java`  
 [Library System README](./LibraryManagementSystem/README.md)

#### Objective  
To build a simple command-line Java application that manages books and users using Object-Oriented Programming.

---

#### What I Did
- Created core classes: `Book`, `User`, and `LibraryManagementSystem`.
- Used basic `for` loops to iterate through `ArrayList`s.
- Implemented features to add books/users, issue and return books, and view all records.
- Managed the state of books (issued or not) with proper validations.
- Ensured smooth terminal-based interaction with clear prompts.

---

#### Features
-  **Add Book** ‚Äì Add a new book with ID and title.
-  **Add User** ‚Äì Register a new user with unique ID and name.
-  **Issue Book** ‚Äì Issue a book if it is not already issued.
-  **Return Book** ‚Äì Return a previously issued book.
-  **View All Books** ‚Äì Display a list of all books with issue status.
-  **Validation** ‚Äì Handles invalid IDs, duplicate issues/returns.

---

#### Technologies Used
- Java (OOP: Classes, Objects, Encapsulation)
- `ArrayList` for dynamic data storage
- `Scanner` for user input
- Loops and conditionals for program flow

---

#### Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in **object modeling** for real-life systems.
- Practiced building CLI-based CRUD functionality in Java.
- Improved skills in class design, data handling, and user input management.
- Understood in-memory logic for record-keeping (like a mini database).

### [Notes App ‚Äì File I/O (Java CLI)](./NotesApp/)

A simple text-based notes manager that lets users write and view notes using file handling in Java.

üìÑ Source File: `NotesApp/NotesApp.java`  
üìù [Notes App README](./NotesApp/README.md)

---

#### Objective  
To create a command-line Java application that manages user notes using **FileWriter** and **FileReader** for permanent storage.

---

#### What I Did
- Developed a Java CLI app that saves user-written notes to a `.txt` file.
- Implemented features to write a new note or view all saved notes.
- Used `FileWriter` in append mode to preserve notes.
- Used `FileReader` and `BufferedReader` to display all previous notes line-by-line.
- Handled file-not-found and I/O exceptions gracefully.

---

#### Features
-  **Write a Note** ‚Äì User can write a note which is saved to `notes.txt`.
-  **View Notes** ‚Äì Reads and displays all saved notes.
-  **Error Handling** ‚Äì Proper messages if file doesn't exist or fails to write.
-  **Persistent Storage** ‚Äì Notes are not lost after program ends.

---

#### Technologies Used
- Java Core
- `FileWriter` for writing notes
- `BufferedReader` & `FileReader` for reading notes
- `Scanner` for user input
- Loops and conditional logic

---

#### Learning Outcomes
- Learned how to work with files in Java using Reader/Writer classes.
- Understood the concept of persistent storage vs. in-memory data.
- Practiced building a real-world utility using core Java.
- Gained confidence in exception handling for file operations.
