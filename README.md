### [Calculator (Java Console-Based)](./Calculator/)

#### Objective:
To build a basic Java program that functions as a calculator using the command-line interface.

#### What I Did:
- Developed a console-based calculator in Java.
- Used `Scanner` to accept input from the user.
- Implemented arithmetic operations using `switch` statements.
- Created a loop-based menu that continues until the user exits.

#### Features:
- Supports **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.
- Menu-driven interface for ease of use.
- Displays results and prompts clearly.
- Handles invalid inputs and divide-by-zero errors (enhanced version).

#### Technologies Used:
- Java (Core)
- Scanner for input
- Control structures (loops, switch-case)

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Practiced writing clean, modular Java code.
- Strengthened understanding of loops, conditions, and input/output in Java.
- Improved skills in building interactive console applications.

###  [Student Record Management System (CLI)](./StudentRecordSystem/)

####  Objective:
To simulate a basic record management system that allows CRUD operations on student data using Java OOP and CLI.

#### What I Did:
- Created a `Student` class with attributes: roll number, name, age, and course.
- Wrote a main class `StudentRecordManagement` to manage the logic.
- Implemented a **menu-based CLI** using loops and `Scanner`.
- Used `ArrayList` to store student objects dynamically.
- Ensured roll number uniqueness and provided feedback for all operations.

#### Features:
- Add new student records.
- View all students and display total count.
- Update existing records by roll number.
- Delete student records.
- Validates duplicate roll numbers.
- Clean and user-friendly output format.

####  Technologies Used:
- Java (OOP concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation)
- ArrayList for dynamic storage
- Scanner for input
- Loops and conditional logic

#### Learning Outcomes:
- Learned to build CRUD-based applications using Java.
- Practiced object-oriented programming.
- Understood how in-memory data storage can simulate databases.
- Improved input handling, validation, and error feedback.
