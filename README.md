# Java Console-Based Calculator

This is a Java program that acts as a simple **console-based calculator** built as part of my internship at **Elevate Labs**.

The program allows users to perform the following mathematical operations:

### Features
- Addition of multiple numbers
- Subtraction of multiple numbers
- Multiplication of multiple numbers
- Division of multiple numbers
- Power (Exponential Calculation)
- Square Root using the Babylonian Method
- Exit option with looped menu

### Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 8+)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Arrays for dynamic input
- Scanner class for user input
- Custom mathematical methods

###  File Included
- `Calculator.java` — Contains both the logic (in `Calculations` class) and the user interface (`main` method in `Calculator` class).

### How to Run
1. Open a terminal or use any Java IDE (VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse).
2. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
## File Location
